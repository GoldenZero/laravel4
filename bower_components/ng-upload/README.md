angular-file-upload
===================


**Here is the <a href="http://angular-file-upload.appspot.com/" target="_blank">DEMO</a>**

Lightweight Angular JS directive to upload files. Features:
* File upload for HTML5 and non-HTML5 browsers with Flash polyfill [FileAPI](https://github.com/mailru/FileAPI). Allows client side validation before uploading the file
* Uses regular `$http` to upload (with shim for non-HTML5 browsers) so all angular `$http` features are available
* Supports upload progress
* Supports cancel/abort upload while in progress
* Supports File drag and drop
* All non-HTML5 code is in a separate shim file and could be easily removed if you only supports HTML5
* Flash FileAPI will be loaded on demand for non-HTML5 FormData browsers so no extra load for HTML5 browsers.
* `$upload` method can be configured to be either `POST` or `PUT` for HTML5 browsers.
* `$upload.http` HTML5 progress event for normal http `POST`/`PUT` requests with the file content or any data.

## Usage

HTML:
```html
<!-- shim to support upload progress/abort and non-HTML5 FormData browsers.-->
<!-- use html5-shim.min.js instead for progress/abort for html5 browsers only-->
<!-- Note: MUST BE PLACED BEFORE angular.js-->
<script src="angular-file-upload-shim.min.js"></script> 
<script src="angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="angular-file-upload.min.js"></script> 

<div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
  <input type="text" ng-model="myModelObj">
  <input type="file" ng-file-select="onFileSelect($files)" >
  <input type="file" ng-file-select="onFileSelect($files)" multiple>
  <div ng-file-drop="onFileSelect($files)" ng-file-drag-over-class="optional-css-class"
        ng-show="dropSupported">drop files here</div>
  <div ng-file-drop-available="dropSupported=true" 
        ng-show="!dropSupported">HTML5 Drop File is not supported!</div>
  <button ng-click="upload.abort()">Cancel Upload</button>
</div>
```

JS:
```js
//inject angular file upload directives and service.
angular.module('myApp', ['angularFileUpload']);

var MyCtrl = [ '$scope', '$upload', function($scope, $upload) {
  $scope.onFileSelect = function($files) {
    //$files: an array of files selected, each file has name, size, and type.
    for (var i = 0; i < $files.length; i++) {
      var file = $files[i];
      $scope.upload = $upload.upload({
        url: 'server/upload/url', //upload.php script, node.js route, or servlet url
        // method: POST or PUT,
        // headers: {'headerKey': 'headerValue'},
        // withCredential: true,
        data: {myObj: $scope.myModelObj},
        file: file,
        // file: $files, //upload multiple files, this feature only works in HTML5 FromData browsers
        /* set file formData name for 'Content-Desposition' header. Default: 'file' */
        //fileFormDataName: myFile, //OR for HTML5 multiple upload only a list: ['name1', 'name2', ...]
        /* customize how data is added to formData. See #40#issuecomment-28612000 for example */
        //formDataAppender: function(formData, key, val){} 
      }).progress(function(evt) {
        console.log('percent: ' + parseInt(100.0 * evt.loaded / evt.total));
      }).success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
        // file is uploaded successfully
        console.log(data);
      });
      //.error(...)
      //.then(success, error, progress); 
    }
  };
}];
```

**Note**: `angular.file-upload-shim.js` must be loaded before `angular.js` and is only needed if you are supporting non-HTML5 FormData browsers or you need to support upload progress or cancel.

**Upload multiple files**: Only for HTML5 FormData browsers (not IE8-9) if you pass an array of files to `file` option it will upload all of them together in one request. In this case the `fileFormDataName` could be an array of names or a single string which would have the index appended to it (i.e. `file0`, `file1`, etc.). If you want a cross browser approach you need to iterate through files and upload them one by one like the code above. This is due to the limitation of Flash file upload.

You can also use `$upload.http()` to send the file binary or any data to the server while being able to listen to progress event. See [#88](https://github.com/danialfarid/angular-file-upload/issues/88) for more details.
This equivalent to angular $http() but allow you to listen to progress event for HTML5 browsers.

## Old browsers

For browsers not supporting HTML5 FormData (IE8, IE9, ...) [FileAPI](https://github.com/mailru/FileAPI) module is used. 
For these browsers these two files are needed:  **`FileAPI.min.js`, `FileAPI.flash.swf`** which will be loaded if the browser does not supports HTML5 FormData (no extra load for HTML5 browsers).

**Note**: Flash needs to be installed on the client browser since `FileAPI` uses Flash to upload files.

You can put these two files beside `angular-file-upload-shim(.min).js` on your server to be loaded automatically on demand or use the following script to set the FileAPI load path (optional):
```html
<script>
    //optional need to be loaded before angular-file-upload-shim(.min).js
    FileAPI = {
        jsPath: '/js/FileAPI.min.js/folder/',
        staticPath: '/flash/FileAPI.flash.swf/folder/'
    }
</script>
<script src="angular-file-upload-shim.min.js"></script>...
```

## Install

Download files from [/dist](https://github.com/danialfarid/angular-file-upload/blob/master/dist) or 
```sh
#notice 'ng' at the beginning of the module name not 'angular'
bower install ng-file-upload 
```

You can find the sample server code in Java/GAE [here](https://github.com/danialfarid/angular-file-upload/blob/master/demo/src/com/df/angularfileupload/FileUpload.java).

If you use this module you can give it a thumbs up at [http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-file-upload](http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-file-upload).
